# Slack Action
> Lightweight github action for posting to slack (using [node-slack-sdk](https://github.com/slackapi/node-slack-sdk)).

Slack action allows you interact with slack while exposing [Github's payload](https://developer.github.com/webhooks/event-payloads/). Pairing with a slack bot, this action is able to `post`, `update`, `react` and `reply` to messages while customizing the channel and message matcher / template.

The main use cases for using this actions is:
1. To monitor all merges to a master branch for tracking completed work (_closed pull requests_). See our example [here](https://github.com/jermainezhimin/slack-actions/blob/master/.github/workflows/post-prs.yml)
2. To post/update notifications when pull requests are ready for review.

## Usage

You can use this action after any other action. Here is an example setup of this action:

1. Create a `.github/workflows/slack-actions.yml` file in your GitHub repo.
2. Add the following code to the `slack-actions.yml` file. Note that the message is javascript code that get executed and provided the `payload` variable which is [provided by github](https://developer.github.com/webhooks/event-payloads/)

```yml
on: push

name: Posting to slack
  steps:
  - name: Posting to slack
    uses: jermainezhimin/slack-actions@v0.1
    with:
      slack-bot-token: ${{ secrets.SLACK_BOT_TOKEN }}
      channel-id: ${{ secrets.SLACK_CHANNEL_ID }}
      action: post
      message: |
        `:star-struck: New commits in _*dev*_!\n
        ${payload.commits.map((commit)=>`â€¢ [_${commit.author.name}_] <${commit.url}|${commit.message}>\n`)}
        `
```

3. Create `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` and `SLACK_CHANNEL_ID` secret using [GitHub Action's Secret](https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/creating-and-storing-encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository). You will need to [generate a Slack bot token from here](https://api.slack.com/authentication/token-types#bot) and assign it the appropriate authorization(see `Setting up Actions`) and [locate the channel ID](https://stackoverflow.com/a/57246565/9932533).

branch. Pull requests are warmly welcome.

### Building / Deploying / Publishing

To publish a new version, we will have to build the project locally with `npm run build` and commit the `dist/` folder to [slack-actions](https://github.com/jermainezhimin/slack-actions).

we will next have to tag the commit by running `git tag -m "<tag message>" <tag name>` (_prefix tags with v and follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org)_) and `git push --tags` to push the tag to the remote origin.

If all tests pass, we will then manually [create a release](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise/2.13/user/articles/creating-releases). Please ensure the changelog and release title is approprately filled.
